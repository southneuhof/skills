# Module contract

Use this contract for every module design, from the first draft through approval.
Start with the [standard module base](../../carta-module-development/references/standard-module.md),
including custom workflows. Keep one decision record as requirements emerge.
Start the draft with the authority table and open questions. Add behavior rules
as facts become clear. Add the workflow inventory when the selected execution
path needs a worksheet.

`plans/<feature>/design.md` owns intended behavior, decisions and approval. On
the full execution path, plans own technical decisions, the worksheet owns
progress, and reports own observed results. On the standard path, the design
also records the work plan and evidence. Use tables for data, resource summaries
and acceptance cases. Use YAML only for custom workflows. Use Mermaid when it
clarifies a branched workflow; diagrams reference the authoritative rules.
Existing approved artifacts can retain their format when they meet this contract.

## Record rules

Assign stable IDs to defined workflows (`W-01`), behaviors (`B-01`), transitions
(`T-01`), invariants (`I-01`) and acceptance cases (`A-01`). Standard CRUD that
uses the Carta pattern needs no action ID. Define each distinct rule once and
link its consumers. Keep reasons and source notes outside executable conditions.
IDs are unique across the design. Tables can repeat under resource headings;
the checker combines tables with the same header and rejects duplicate IDs.
A blank required property is incomplete. `NONE` is an explicit absence;
`UNRESOLVED` blocks affected work. An unchanged contract reference names its
path and symbol or rule ID. Define technical terms before using them.

## Authority and scope

Record feature, revision, status (`DRAFT`, `APPROVED`, `BLOCKED`), approval source,
date and scope. Separate current behavior from intended changes. A new entity
does not imply additional CRUD actions, collections or administration screens. Record actors,
entry points, outcomes, exclusions, affected owners and consumers using
[context discovery](context-discovery.md).

| Claim ID | Statement | Authority | Source | Affected behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|

Authority is `OBSERVED` for current evidence, `CONFIRMED` for user requirements,
`PROPOSED` for recommendations, or `UNKNOWN` for missing knowledge. Use one
classification per claim; separate observed facts from proposed decisions. Record conflicts
and their resolution. Approval identifies the exact revision; silence is not approval.

Trace supplied process branches and UI requirements to design statements, rule
IDs or explicit exclusions. When sources differ, name which source governs each
affected behavior.
Treat an inferred rule as a proposal until confirmed; general approval does not
resolve contradictory rules within the same revision.

## Data tables

For each new or changed entity, name its meaning, owner and identity. Use:

| Field | Meaning | Stored type / values | Initial value | Required by action | Writable by action | Omitted / null input | Uniqueness scope / derivation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Relationship | Cardinality | Owner | Valid references | Parent-change effects | Delete / recovery effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Specify precision, units, time basis and rounding where meaningful. Include
migration of existing data, retained file keys versus URLs, dependent selection
clearing, and mutable versus derived values where applicable. Reference unchanged
schema owners instead of copying them.

## Workflow inventory

For the full execution path, list every in-scope branch, invariant and required
sequence in this coverage table. Standard CRUD that follows the named Carta
pattern needs no obligation row.
Use one row per obligation; `Obligation` is a unique ID, including workflow path
IDs such as `W-01.normal`. Include alternative entry points, return/resubmit paths,
permitted prerequisite orders and cross-module effects when they exist.

| Obligation | Rule references | Acceptance IDs |
|---|---|---|

For a full-path worksheet, keep this legacy checker table empty:

| Journey | Obligation | Acceptance IDs | Distinct interaction |
|---|---|---|---|

Reason: E2E is outside module delivery under the
[verification boundary](../../carta-module-development/references/verification-strategy.md#browser-journeys).
Describe UI behavior in resource summaries and custom action records, not
browser test mappings. On resume,
move old journey obligations to separately scoped work; do not mark them passed.

Present the inventory during full-path design review. The worksheet checker
cannot discover business work omitted here. Explicit exclusions belong in scope,
not this table.

On the full execution path, every defined behavior, transition and invariant
must appear in the inventory's Rule references. Use exact IDs, not ID ranges.

## Shared rules

Define a condition used by several actions once, as an invariant:

| Invariant ID | Condition that must remain true |
|---|---|
| I-01 | Each newly selected division is active when the write occurs. |

Use the existing I-ID family. State when the condition applies, including whether
it applies to existing records or only new selections. Resource summaries,
custom actions and acceptance rows reference the ID; field definitions remain
the owner of field rules.

## Standard resources

Summarize requested standard actions once per resource:

| Resource | Requested actions | Access and scope | UI entry and result | Carta pattern | Differences |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Name action-specific access in the resource row when it differs. Reference field
definitions for requiredness, defaults, writable fields and omitted/null values.
Reference the existing Carta owner for ordinary behavior. Give each required
difference, such as an immutable field, relation constraint, custom filter or
action restriction, one rule and a suitable acceptance case. Define shared
rules once. Describe distinct UI interactions and save/reload outcomes where
they affect the requested result.

Choose YAML when an action implements a custom workflow with conditions,
transitions or coupled effects. A feature can contain both formats.

## Custom workflows

For custom conditions, transitions or coupled effects, read
[custom-workflows.md](custom-workflows.md). It defines the workflow state and
YAML action/acceptance records. Load it only for that part of a mixed module.

## Acceptance records

Expected values come from confirmed rules and worked examples, not implementation.
Cover each independent condition, transition branch and invariant. Include boundary
and rejection cases that distinguish plausible wrong results, plus complete sequence
cases where isolated action tests cannot prove the workflow.

For a required difference in standard CRUD, use one independently checkable
outcome per row. Ordinary actions covered by the named Carta pattern need no
separate acceptance row:

| ID | Rule references | Given | Action and input | Expected result and stored/unchanged values | Required visible result |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Several rows can share a test when its assertions prove each outcome. Use
concrete values that distinguish plausible faults. Include allowed and denied
access, omitted and cleared values, and retained values where the rules require
them. Custom workflow acceptance follows the linked workflow reference.

## Boundaries and readiness

Record interfaces to preserve, permitted environments, and technical decisions
reserved for planning. The planner settles architecture; the executor receives
routine coding freedom only. Framework edits and external/destructive writes
require explicit authority; design approval does not authorize deployment.

Ready means each requested resource and action is in scope, each distinct rule
has an unambiguous definition and suitable check, sources and owners are
identifiable, and no in-scope business decision remains unresolved. On the full
execution path, every inventory obligation has acceptance cases. Review conflicts
and missing behavior, not headings alone. Record the approved revision and
decision sources.
A changed rule reopens its affected approval, plans and evidence; preserve valid work.
Only new or changed business decisions need approval. Technical completion of a
record preserves the existing approval scope.

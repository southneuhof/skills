# UI contract check

For changed web surfaces, record `plans/<feature>/ui-contract.json`. Paths are
repository-relative. Select current public exports; default imports use `default`.

```json
{
  "surfaces": [
    {
      "file": "apps/web/src/routes/items/index.route.vue",
      "kind": "list",
      "components": [{ "name": "ListView", "from": "@southneuhof/loom" }]
    },
    {
      "file": "apps/web/src/routes/items/detail.route.vue",
      "kind": "detail",
      "components": [{ "name": "DetailView", "from": "@southneuhof/loom" }]
    }
  ]
}
```

List each changed route and its local surface components. `kind` is `list`,
`detail`, `create`, `update` or `custom`; it describes the user task and determines the required standard View. A workflow
record is still `detail`. The checker enforces kind for conventional detail,
create and edit route filenames. `custom` is for other surfaces, such as dashboards. `components` names the
framework exports that the template must use; an unused import fails. Slots and
adjacent sections extend the selected View. A lower-level component needs a `gap`
that names the unsupported requirement and local owner. A custom record layout
retains `Detail`; cards and a header alone do not meet the record contract. Review that claim against
current source. Standard use needs no explanation.

A requested standard Create override adds
`"extensions": [{"slot": "create-action", "reason": "<required interaction>"}]`.
An unused exception fails. Use framework default action labels unless the product
explicitly requires different text. Inspect label props or the app dictionary
before replacing a control. A mock label or plan action name does not require exact copy. Cite the explicit
text requirement when a control override exists only to change its label.

Run from the repository root and record the command with module evidence:

```sh
node scripts/module-ui-check.mjs plans/<feature>/ui-contract.json
```

Exit `0` means the declared static checks pass; `1` means defects; `2` means
exceptions need review. The orchestrator resolves each exception against the
requirement and component source before acceptance. The executor cannot approve
its own deviation.

The checker uses the installed Vue parser. It checks template component bindings,
selected imports in template use, and declared Create overrides. Vue built-ins
and Vue Router components are recognized; confirm the app installs its router.
For explicit globals, add `"globals": [{"tag": "SharedWidget", "registration":
"apps/web/src/main.ts"}]`. The checker requires a literal `.component()` call;
the reviewer confirms that registration runs. Type declarations and test stubs
are not runtime registration.

Dynamic components, plugin registration and aliases outside supported syntax
need source review or a focused extension to the checker. A binding check cannot
prove that an imported module exports the symbol; run the app type check too.
Compare the contract with the complete changed file list. Inspect file renderers,
slots and adjacent sections; a token View beside a replacement body is a defect.
A static pass does not prove requirement coverage, runtime behavior or acceptance.

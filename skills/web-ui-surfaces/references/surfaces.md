# Surfaces and actions

Read `docs/ui/surfaces.md` before this implementation reference. Read
`docs/ui/collections.md` when the surface has filters, tabs, tables, or card
collections.

## Surface map

| Need | Use |
|---|---|
| Standard list | `ListView v-bind="resource.list()"` |
| Standard detail | `DetailView v-bind="resource.detail({ id })"` |
| Standard create or update | `FormView` with the matching action prop bag |
| Custom collection | `Table` or `ListView #collection`; `Table` keeps collection states |
| Custom record | `Detail` |
| Custom form | `Form` or `DialogForm` |
| Tree | `TreeTable` |
| List query controls | `ListView #filters` with `Form` or `ChipFilter` |
| Dialog, confirmation, button, card, feedback | Existing framework composite or base component |

## Standard resource path

Resource actions are independent. Match the actions proved by legacy and the
approved design; a standard resource does not need all CRUD actions. Omit an
unsupported action and its route. Do not add update because create exists, and
do not replace a supported route-based action with a modal. Each supported
standard create or update action uses its own `FormView` route.

Use the module schema, one field catalog, and the app Hono adapter:

```ts
const api = createHonoResourceActions(rpc.items)
const fields = defineFields(itemsSchema, {
  name: { label: 'Name', form: { renderer: 'text' } },
})

export const items = defineResource(itemsSchema, {
  key: 'items',
  actions: {
    list: { run: api.list, fields: [fields.name], permission: 'view-items', route: { name: 'items' } },
    detail: { run: api.detail, fields: [fields.name], permission: 'view-items', route: { name: 'items-detail', params: (id) => ({ itemId: String(id) }) } },
    create: { run: api.create, fields: [fields.name], permission: 'create-items', route: { name: 'items-create' } },
    update: { run: api.update, fields: [fields.name], permission: 'update-items', route: { name: 'items-edit', params: (id) => ({ itemId: String(id) }) } },
    delete: { run: api.delete, permission: 'delete-items' },
  },
})
```

Use a generated route name that exists in `apps/web/route-map.d.ts`. Do not
pass `dataAdapter` to `createHonoResourceActions`; it already owns response
normalization.

Select field references in the visible order for each action. Omission removes
a field from that surface. Use one terminal `.override(...)` for one local
field difference.

## Action prop bags

Pass standard actions directly:

```vue
<ListView v-bind="items.list()" />
<DetailView v-bind="items.detail({ id })" />
<FormView v-bind="items.create()" />
<DialogForm v-bind="items.update({ id })" v-model:open="open" />
```

`Form` and `DialogForm` accept a structural `{ run }` action bag. Do not add a
wrapper such as `dialogFormOf`, and do not compose raw `Dialog` + `Form` when
`DialogForm` fits.

## Collection variants and action overrides

Use `ListView #collection` to show a card or grid view of the same loaded
collection. It keeps one `Collection` through `Table`, so do not start another
loader or rebuild query/cache state. The slot supplies records and standard
`actions`; use those actions instead of rebuilding route or permission logic.
The framework renders loading, error, and empty states before it invokes the
custom collection slot.

For a custom standard control in `ListView`, use:

- `#create-action` only to replace the standard Create action
- `#resource-action` for Import, Export, Download, and other resource actions
- `#row-actions-view`
- `#row-actions-edit`
- `#row-actions-delete`

The Create and resource-action slots share one right-aligned action row, with
Create first. A resource action does not replace Create. The framework owns
whether a standard-action override can render. The route owns how its control
looks and runs. Do not add a second permission `v-if` around override content.
A server record capability without a declared standard action or override does
not create a control.

Do not feed `ListView` a synthetic `run` that returns a local ref. Declare a
real scoped list action so collection caching, loading, errors, and query state
stay intact.

## Custom surfaces

For a tree or other surface outside standard Views:

- Use `resourceCan(resource)` from `apps/web/src/framework/access.ts` so the
  resource permission remains the single source.
- Use `useConfirmDelete` with `ConfirmationDialog` for the shared custom delete
  flow.
- Use `errorMessage(error, fallback)` from the app normalization adapter.

Keep server-derived record actions or `allowedOperations` as the record-level
authority. API authorization still runs on submit.

## Filters and tabs

Follow `docs/ui/collections.md`. Keep query state route-local. Use
`ChipFilter` for a collection query and state its optional or required
selection contract. Use framework `Tabs` for one selected local surface or
presentation. Use the app routing Tabs component for route navigation.

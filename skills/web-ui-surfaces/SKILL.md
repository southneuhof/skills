# Web UI surfaces

Read [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md) before selecting page structure or controls.
It owns app layout and display conventions, including custom action pages.

## Find the current boundary

Apply [discovery reuse](../carta-module-development/SKILL.md#discovery-reuse).
Start with the changed route/resource or generated source and the applicable
reference below. Reuse the plan's verified adapter and component choices.
Inspect an export or one nearby example only for an unresolved contract.
Before writing each new interaction pattern, identify its View or form, input
renderers, display renderers, value contract, action owner, and visible parent.
For custom reads or writes, read the
[query-cache contract](../carta-module-development/references/web-query-cache.md).
Identify the loading owner and every data consumer affected by a write.
Read [Fields](references/fields.md) for every resource display and
[File routing](references/file-routing.md) for every child section.
Discovery is complete when each visible field has a supported display path,
and each interaction has supported configuration, route placement, loading and
refresh ownership, or a named framework gap. Keep these
decisions in the existing work record and reuse them for matching interactions.

Read `docs/architecture/web-application-architecture.md` when ownership or app
integration is unclear; use `docs/ui/README.md` for technical UI references.
Inspect `apps/web/src/main.ts`, app defaults or the authenticated layout only
when changing their setup or resolving a registration/default problem. Read
the navigation manifest when adding an entry. Keep framework changes within scope.

## Framework-first composition

Use established framework patterns directly. Select the highest-level component
that supports the required interaction, including its states and feedback.
Before adding custom UI behavior, check the relevant component contract and
extension points. Use supported slots, fields, actions and framework controls;
keep custom code limited to the unmet requirement.

Select in order: standard View/action, supported slot or adjacent section,
lower-level framework component, then local code for a named unmet requirement.
Apply [action placement](../../../DESIGN.md#actions-and-forms). Check existing
examples against the design rules before reusing their composition.
Import template components or identify their runtime registration; a test stub
or type declaration does not register a component.

Check composition once per interaction pattern. Standard work records only a
real deviation in its work document; it needs no UI JSON. Use the
[UI contract](references/ui-contract.md) for full-process work, an existing
contract or custom composition that needs static checking. Review deviations
against the required result, not merely whether a slot supports them.

## Choose and build

| Work | Read |
| --- | --- |
| New page, app shell, navigation, visual hierarchy, responsive layout | [App conventions](references/app-conventions.md) |
| File routes, nested parents, tabs, Back, route lifecycle | [File routing](references/file-routing.md) |
| Lists, cards, filters, actions, dialogs | [Surfaces](references/surfaces.md) |
| Workflow detail, history, related records | [Detail layout](references/detail-layout.md) |
| Any new or changed relation, display fields or labels | [Fields](references/fields.md) |
| Any user input, including custom actions and inline uploads; read before selecting controls | [Build resource forms](../build-resource-form/SKILL.md) |

Routes own URLs, query state, navigation, dialogs, and workflow feedback.
Schemas own data validation. A resource owns standard actions and one shared
field catalog. Pass the returned action directly to its View:

```vue
<ListView v-bind="records.list()" />
<DetailView v-bind="records.detail({ id })" />
<FormView v-bind="records.create()" />
<FormView v-bind="records.update({ id })" />
```

Use `createHonoResourceActions(rpc.<module>)` for standard transport. It already
normalizes responses. Keep custom transport in app actions. For custom resource
actions, use the [action contract](references/surfaces.md#custom-resource-actions).
Routes do not call raw RPC endpoints.
A file or wrapper earns its place when it owns behavior; simple standard
resources can call the adapter directly without a separate actions file.

## Check the result

Use [verification](references/verification.md). Report visible behavior checked,
failed checks, and any unverified result. Reuse the parent module's evidence;
do not start a second verification process.

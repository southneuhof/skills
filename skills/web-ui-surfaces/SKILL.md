# Web UI surfaces

Use Carta's page shells and controls as the starting point. Adapt content,
density, and layout to the user's task. Consistency comes from shared controls,
clear hierarchy, and predictable behavior, not identical pages.

## Find the current boundary

Read `docs/architecture/web-application-architecture.md`, `docs/ui/README.md`,
and the UI branch for the changed surface. Inspect its route, schema, resource,
app adapter, and the relevant Loom exports. For a new app surface, inspect
`apps/web/src/main.ts`, app defaults, navigation manifest, and authenticated
layout before adding another owner for them.

Use nearby modules as evidence, then check their pattern against the current
public API. Reuse a pattern already checked in this task while its contract is
unchanged. Keep framework changes within explicit user scope.

## Framework-first composition

Use established framework patterns directly. Select the highest-level component
that supports the required interaction, including its states and feedback.
Before adding custom UI behavior, check the relevant component contract and
extension points. Use supported slots, fields, actions and framework controls;
keep custom code limited to the unmet requirement.

Select in order: standard View/action, supported slot or adjacent section,
lower-level framework component, then local code for a named unmet requirement.
Keep standard Create controls unless the requested interaction needs an override.
Import template components or identify their runtime registration; a test stub
or type declaration does not register a component.

Record each changed surface's component, extension and actual gap in the plan's
[UI contract](references/ui-contract.md). Check once per interaction pattern.
Run the contract check before handoff; review every exception against the current
component source. A custom layout retains framework controls and field rendering.

## Choose and build

| Work | Read |
| --- | --- |
| New page, app shell, navigation, visual hierarchy, responsive layout | [App conventions](references/app-conventions.md) |
| File routes, nested parents, tabs, Back, route lifecycle | [File routing](references/file-routing.md) |
| Lists, cards, filters, actions, dialogs | [Surfaces](references/surfaces.md) |
| Workflow detail, history, related records | [Detail layout](references/detail-layout.md) |
| Display fields and relation labels | [Fields](references/fields.md) |
| Form values, sources, dependencies, child editing | [Build resource forms](../build-resource-form/SKILL.md) |

Routes own URLs, query state, navigation, dialogs, and workflow feedback.
Schemas own data validation. A resource owns standard actions and one shared
field catalog. Pass the returned action directly to its View:

```vue
<ListView v-bind="records.list()" />
<DetailView v-bind="records.detail({ id })" />
<FormView v-bind="records.create()" />
<FormView v-bind="records.update({ id })" />
```

Use `createHonoResourceActions(rpc.<module>)` for standard transport. It already
normalizes responses. Keep custom transport in app actions, with a typed
`{ run }` resource action when needed. Routes do not call raw RPC endpoints.
A file or wrapper earns its place when it owns behavior; simple standard
resources can call the adapter directly without a separate actions file.

## Check the result

Use [verification](references/verification.md). Report visible behavior checked,
failed checks, and any unverified result. Reuse the parent module's evidence;
do not start a second verification process.

# Optional bounded generator

Use this only for a new single resource whose approved design includes all five
standard actions (list, detail, create, update, delete), a generated text UUID
identity, primitive fields and system-wide permissions. The current generator
supports that shape, not arbitrary module contracts.

Action subsets, record-scoped/project permissions, relations, owned children,
workflows, custom writes/surfaces and risky existing-data migrations use normal
implementation plans. Keep the approved scope; never add actions to fit the
generator. Generator eligibility is independent of business uncertainty or risk.
Unknown manifest extensions are rejected rather than silently ignored.

## Manifest

Write `plans/<feature>/module.json` after the design gate. The generic token is
`kind: "bounded-module"`. `navigation.group` selects any existing authenticated
route and navigation group; the generator does not assign a business group.

```json
{
  "kind": "bounded-module",
  "slug": "service-levels",
  "table": "service_levels",
  "symbol": "ServiceLevel",
  "title": "Service Levels",
  "identity": { "key": "id", "type": "text", "primary": true, "generated": "uuid" },
  "fields": [
    { "key": "name", "type": "text", "label": "Name", "required": true, "renderer": "text" },
    { "key": "active", "type": "boolean", "label": "Active", "required": true, "renderer": "checkbox", "default": true }
  ],
  "labels": {
    "listTitle": "Service Levels",
    "detailTitle": "Service Level",
    "createTitle": "Create Service Level",
    "editTitle": "Edit Service Level",
    "submitLabel": "Save"
  },
  "permissions": {
    "moduleName": "Service Levels",
    "realm": "system",
    "entries": {
      "list": { "name": "List service levels", "description": "List service levels." },
      "detail": { "name": "View service level", "description": "View a service level." },
      "create": { "name": "Create service level", "description": "Create a service level." },
      "update": { "name": "Update service level", "description": "Update a service level." },
      "delete": { "name": "Delete service level", "description": "Delete a service level." }
    }
  },
  "navigation": {
    "group": "settings",
    "after": "settings-roles",
    "title": "Service Levels",
    "icon": "folder",
    "separator": "Configuration"
  }
}
```

Use `actionFields` when list, detail, create, and update have different field
sets. Add `seed` only when the design requires stable initial records.

## Check and generate

Inspect `--help` for the actual helper interface. Validate without writing source:

```sh
python3 .agents/skills/carta-module-development/scripts/scaffold_bounded.py --manifest plans/<feature>/module.json --check --json
```

After implementation is authorized, generate and integrate source explicitly:

```sh
python3 .agents/skills/carta-module-development/scripts/scaffold_bounded.py --manifest plans/<feature>/module.json --apply --json
```

The wrapper checks eligibility and integration anchors before source generation.
It never runs a database migration, seed, application test or external write.
It refuses existing generated files. On partial failure, inspect the reported
changed files rather than blindly restarting or overwriting them.

Review the generated schema and SQL migration, add the contract-specific tests,
and use the plan's isolated test environment. The generated tests are smoke
checks, not proof of accepted/denied CRUD, field validation or consumer behavior.
When optional seed records are present, integration registers the module's seed
in the current `seedDatabase` owner; the plan still decides which environment
may execute it.

The root `scaffold:bounded-module`, `integrate:bounded-module` and `verify:module`
commands expose the individual tools. `verify:module --check-only` performs
static checks; `--run` runs its listed non-browser commands and stops at the
first failure. `--reports <unique-directory>` preserves summary and command
outputs. Read [verification-strategy.md](verification-strategy.md) for status
scope, additional business tests, evidence freshness and semantic acceptance.

# Closing the Loop — execute, reconcile, issues

The advisor's job doesn't end at the plan. This file covers the three follow-through flows: implementing and reviewing a selected plan (`execute`), keeping the plan backlog alive (`reconcile`), and publishing plans where work gets picked up (`--issues`).

The founding rule applies to audit and planning: **the advisor does not edit source code until the user explicitly selects `execute`.** In `execute`, implement the selected plan directly, then review the diff and render a verdict like a tech lead. Do not merge, push, or commit to the user's branch unless explicitly asked.

## `execute <plan>` — implement and review

### Preconditions (check all before implementation)

- The repo is a git repository. If not: stop and say so.
- The plan file exists and its dependencies show DONE in `plans/README.md`. If not: stop, name the missing dependency.
- Run the plan's drift check yourself. If in-scope files changed since `Planned at`, reconcile the plan first (see below) — don't implement a stale plan.

### Implementation

Read the full plan, execute each step in order, run every verification command, and stop at any stated STOP condition. Touch only the files listed as in scope. Do not improvise around obstacles; record the exact observation and the affected step. Before reviewing, record the implementation status, verification results, files changed, and any deviations.

```
STATUS: COMPLETE | STOPPED
STEPS: per step — done/skipped + verification command result
STOPPED BECAUSE: (only if STOPPED) which STOP condition, what was observed
FILES CHANGED: list
NOTES: anything the reviewer should know (deviations, surprises, judgment calls)
```

### Review

Review like a tech lead reviewing a PR against the plan:

1. **Re-run every done criterion** in the current working tree. Don't trust the implementation notes — verify.
2. **Scope compliance**: inspect the current diff against the plan's in-scope list. Any file outside scope fails review, full stop.
3. **Read the full diff.** Judge it against "Why this matters" (does it solve the actual problem?) and the repo conventions named in the plan (does it look like the rest of the codebase?).
4. **Audit the new tests.** A test that asserts nothing meaningful can pass `pnpm test` and prove nothing. Read what the tests assert.

### Verdict

**Documented deviations are judged on merit, not reflex-blocked.** "Do not improvise" exists to stop silent drift; an executor that hits a real obstacle (e.g. the plan's approach breaks existing test mocks), adapts minimally, and explains it in NOTES has done the right thing. Approve it if the adaptation serves the plan's intent and stays in scope; treat *undocumented* deviations as review failures.

| Verdict | When | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **APPROVE** | Criteria pass, scope clean, quality holds | Update index status to DONE. Present the diff summary and any deviations. **Merging is the user's decision — never merge, push, or commit to their branch.** |
| **REVISE** | Fixable gaps | Make a focused correction with specific, actionable feedback, then re-run the affected criteria and review again. **Max 2 revision rounds**, then BLOCK. |
| **BLOCK** | STOP condition hit, scope violated unrecoverably, or revisions exhausted | Mark BLOCKED in the index with the reason. Refine or rewrite the plan with what was learned. Tell the user what happened and what changed in the plan. |

The no-mutating-commands rule applies during audit and planning; `execute` is the explicit user-authorized implementation flow.

## `reconcile` — keep `plans/` alive

Process what happened since the last session. Read `plans/README.md` and every plan file, then per status:

- **DONE** — spot-check that the done criteria still hold on the current HEAD (cheap ones only). Mark verified in the index. Don't delete plan files — they're the record.
- **BLOCKED** — read the reason. Investigate the underlying obstacle in the codebase. Either rewrite the plan around it (new number if the approach changed fundamentally, in-place refresh otherwise) or mark REJECTED with one line of rationale.
- **IN PROGRESS** (stale) — flag it to the user and inspect the current working tree for partial progress.
- **TODO** — run the drift check. If drifted: re-verify the finding still exists (it may have been fixed in passing), then refresh the "Current state" excerpts and `Planned at` SHA. If the finding is gone, mark REJECTED ("fixed independently").

Finish with a short report: what's verified done, what was refreshed, what's rejected, and what's executable right now.

## `--issues` — publish plans as GitHub issues

Modifier on any planning invocation (`/improve --issues`, `/improve security --issues`). The flag is the user's authorization to create issues — never create them without it.

1. Preflight: `gh auth status` succeeds and the repo has a GitHub remote. If either fails, write the plan files as normal and say why issues were skipped.
2. Visibility check: `gh repo view --json visibility`. If the repo is **public**, warn the user that issues are publicly visible and get explicit confirmation before publishing any plan that describes a security vulnerability, credential location, or other sensitive finding.
3. Show the list of titles about to become issues; confirm once if interactive.
4. Per plan: `gh issue create --title "<plan title>" --body-file <plan file>`. Labels: `improve` plus the category — apply only if the labels exist or can be created without erroring; skip labels rather than fail.
5. Record each issue URL in the plan's Status block (`- **Issue**: <url>`) and the index.

The plan file remains the source of truth; the issue is distribution. The self-containment rule pays off here — the issue body needs no edits to make sense to whoever (or whatever) picks it up.

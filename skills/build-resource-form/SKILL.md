# Build resource forms

Read the owning API entity, schema, resource, and route. Check the current
`packages/loom/README.md` field contract and `apps/web/src/framework/inputs/registry.ts`.
Use [web-ui-surfaces](../web-ui-surfaces/SKILL.md) for page composition and
`docs/ui/forms.md` for app form defaults.

## Define the value contract

Bind standard API schemas with `defineSchema` and `fromZod(schema)`. Infer parsed
types; add a local form transform only when the control and API shapes differ.
Keep custom action schemas separate from standard CRUD schemas.

For file/image fields in standard or custom actions, read the
[asset-object contract](../carta-module-development/references/frontend-field-contract.md#objects-and-identifiers)
before selecting the write schema. Use that contract to resolve an input mismatch.

Use one `defineFields` catalog. Select only each action's fields in its required
order. A schema key string uses the app field default; a field reference adds
module behavior. One terminal `.override(...)` handles one action difference.
Keep `display.read` for display projection and `form.write` for necessary submit
conversion. Omit identity functions and copied input/output type wrappers.

Account for every required write value: user input, fixed parent context, or
server-owned data. Show editable required fields. Supply fixed values through
`initialData`; keep server-owned values out of client write schemas. Do not add
hidden controls merely to satisfy a schema.

Use `form.initialValue` for a fresh omitted-key default. Loaded values and
explicit `false`, `null`, or empty values must win. The draft stores control
values; the submit copy passes through the field writer, schema, then business
validators. A failed submit must preserve the draft.

## Select controls

Read [field choices](references/form-field-types.md) for value-specific guidance.
Use the registered renderer, then an existing composite. Use `table`/`TableInput`
for form-owned row arrays. If those cannot express one domain value, use the
[custom field contract](references/custom-field-contract.md).

Group fields by the user's task. Put prerequisite fields before dependent
fields. The outer form owns label, required state, error, help, and grid span.
Use the app's language and domain terms; preserve legacy copy only when the
request makes it authoritative. Add help for non-obvious format or consequence.

Apply the [framework-first composition rule](../web-ui-surfaces/SKILL.md#framework-first-composition)
once per form pattern. Use `FormView` for an independent page and `DialogForm` for
a contextual form. Pass the standard action bag directly. Keep final form actions together
at the bottom; use the app submit default unless a specific workflow label is
clearer. Let the form own draft, validation, pending state, and ordinary close
behavior instead of adding parallel state in the route.

## Configure relation sources

Use the owner resource as `source`. Its `list` action supplies server search and
paging; `detail` resolves a selected record outside the current page. Static
arrays are for closed choices, not database collections. Pass filters through
`searchParameters`; the owner endpoint owns their contract.

For a parent-dependent field:

```ts
behavior: {
  disabled: ({ draft }) => !draft.divisionId,
  props: ({ draft }) => ({ searchParameters: { divisionId: draft.divisionId } }),
  resetWhen: ({ draft }) => draft.divisionId,
},
```

Use pure synchronous behavior. `visible` controls field presence and submission;
`disabled` controls editing; `derived` calculates a non-editable value. Hidden
fields are omitted, so the schema and server must agree on conditional values.
If several dependencies can invalidate a child, the reset key must reflect
each one; a truthy `a || b` expression can hide changes to `b`.

Use `context` for stable screen information. Standard create/update actions
supply reserved `context.operation` and `context.permission`. Where the source
requires action scope, use that permission rather than a hard-coded create
permission. The server validates it; a query parameter grants no authority.

For multi lookup/select, use `selectionValues(exactItemSchema)`: keep exact
selected record objects and submit them unchanged. Do not add an ID-array
writer. Use the asset adapter for file/image hydration and submission.

## Connect writes

Read [backend form contract](references/backend-form-contract.md) when a source
or write contract changes. Use a custom action for a distinct domain operation,
not another options endpoint. Give it only its actual input fields. Keep state
checks and atomic parent/child writes on the server. A child with independent
screens or permissions needs its own resource; a row owned by one form does not.

Continue authorized implementation choices. Ask only for a missing decision
that changes business behavior, access, or transaction semantics. A framework
package change needs explicit scope; a supported local custom field does not.

## Verify

Use [UI verification](../web-ui-surfaces/references/verification.md). Select a
check that can fail on the changed value or interaction: dependency reset,
selected-record hydration, conditional submit, row edit, or failed-save recovery.
Check server rejection of a forged relation when the write boundary changes.
Do not add tests that merely copy field order, labels, renderer names, or action
objects. Reuse existing evidence for unchanged framework behavior.
